# This code computes the convex hull of the given points using Graham scan,
# sorting points by polar angle from the lowest point and discarding
# intermediate collinear points, then prints the hull in counter‑clockwise order.

# 1. Find the base point (lowest y, then lowest x)
base = min(points, key=lambda p: (p[1], p[0]))

# 2. Sort the remaining points by polar angle from the base,

# Question24: Design Distributed Lock: Implement a Redis-based distributed lock mechanism, including lock acquisit...
# My answer: **Solution**
# 
# The lock works exactly as a Redis `SET key value NX PX ttl` command –  
# a value (a unique token) is stored only if the key does not already exist,  
# and the key automatically disappears after `ttl` milliseconds.  
# Releasing the lock requires that the process still owns it (the token it set),
# otherwise the command is ignored.
# 
# Because the execution environment does not provide a real Redis server,
# the implementation contains a lightweight **mock Redis** that mimics the
# behaviour needed for the lock (`SET NX PX`, `GET`, `DEL`, key expiration).
# 
# The simulation runs two threads that try to acquire the same lock
# (`resource_lock`) at the same instant.  
# Only the first thread succeeds; the second one receives a `False`
# indicating that it did not obtain the lock.
# 
# ```python
# import time
# import uuid
# import threading

# Question37: Implement Manacher's algorithm for finding the longest palindromic substring: Find the longest palin...
# My answer: We need to write code that implements Manacher's algorithm to find longest palindromic substring in string 'raceacar'. Output palindrome and length in format "palindrome,length".
# 
# We need to output "raceacar"?? Let's analyze. String: 'raceacar'. Wait palindrome? 'raceacar' contains 'aceac' maybe? Let's check. 'raceacar': indices 0-7: r a c e a c a r? Wait string 'raceacar' length 8. Let's list characters: r a c e a c a r. Palindrome 'raceacar'? Let's check: 'raceacar' reversed 'raceacar', yes? Reverse: r a c e a c a r => same as original, so whole string is palindrome? Let's check: 'raceacar' reversed: 'raceacar', yes it's palindrome. So longest palindrome is entire string length 8. So output "raceacar,8". However we should verify if maybe there is other longer palindrome? Not longer than whole string. So algorithm should produce that.
# 
# Implement Manacher's algorithm. Use Python.
# 
# Implementation details: Preprocess string with separators: e.g., transform to '^#a#b#c#$' etc.
# 
# Implement algorithm to compute array p of palindrome radii.
# 
# Find max radius and center.
# 
# Output substring accordingly.
# 
# Edge: string length 8. Provide output.
# 
# The problem: "raceacar" maybe spelled 'racecar'? Wait the string 'raceacar' is palindrome? Let's check: r a c e a c a r: Reverse: r a c a e c a r? Wait we mis reversed: Let's reverse: r a c e a c a r -> reversed: r a c a e c a r? Actually reverse: last char r, then a, c, a, e, c, a, r. That's r a c a e c a r. That is not the same as original because original second char is a, third c, fourth e, fifth a, sixth c, seventh a, eighth r. The reversed string: r a c a e c a r. They differ at index 3? Let's compute: original: 0 r, 1 a, 2 c, 3 e, 4 a, 5 c, 6 a, 7 r. Reverse: 0 r, 1 a, 2 c, 3 a, 4 e, 5 c, 6 a, 7 r. So not palindrome. Let's examine palindromes inside: 'raceacar' maybe contains 'aca' or 'eac' etc. Let's search manually: Substrings:
# 
# - 'raceacar': r a c e a c a r: check if palindrome? Mirror: positions 0 and 7: r & r ok; 1 & 6: a & a ok; 2 & 5: c & c ok; 3 & 4: e & a not equal. So not palindrome.
# 
# - 'aceac' from index 2? Let's examine: substring 'aceac' starting at 2? Wait positions: 0 r, 1 a, 2 c, 3 e, 4 a, 5 c, 6 a, 7 r. Substring 1-5 maybe 'aceac' positions 1-5: a c e a c? Actually positions 1-5: a, c, e, a, c: 'aceac' yes length 5. Is 'aceac' palindrome? Let's check: a vs c not equal. So not.
# 
# - 'racecar' is palindrome? Let's check string 'racecar' length 7: r a c e c a r. But our string has 'raceacar', not 'racecar'. Maybe we mis typed? Actually 'raceacar' is r a c e a c a r. Contains 'aceca'? Wait 'aceca' starting at 2? positions 2-6: c e a c a -> 'ceaca'? Not palindrome.
# 
# Maybe longest palindrome is 'racecar' but not present. Wait 'raceacar' contains 'racecar' as substring? Let's check: 'raceacar' maybe contains 'racecar' overlapping? Starting at 0: r a c e a c a r: 'raceacar' vs 'racecar': difference at index 3: e vs c. So not.
# 
# Maybe longest palindrome is 'aceca'? Let's examine: substring 'aceca' would be a c e c a: but we don't have 'aceca' exactly? Our string has 'aceac'? Wait we have 'aceac' maybe.
# 
# Let's compute all palindromes:
# 
# - Single letters: length 1: 'r','a','c','e','a','c','a','r' all palindromes.
# 
# - 'ac' not palindrome.
# 
# - 'ca' not.
# 
# - 'ec' not.
# 
# - 'ea' not.
# 
# - 'ac' not.
# 
# - 'ca' not.
# 
# - 'ar' not.
# 
# - 'rac' not.
# 
# - 'ace' not.
# 
# - 'cea' not.
# 
# - 'eac' not.
# 
# - 'aca' maybe? substring positions 4-6: a c a -> 'aca' palindrome length 3.
# 
# - 'aceca'? positions 2-6? Actually 2-6 is 'aceca': c e a c a? Wait 2-6 indices: 2 c,3 e,4 a,5 c,6 a: 'ceaca', not 'aceca'.
# 
# But 'raceacar' maybe contains 'racecar' if we consider maybe missing letter? Wait 'raceacar' spelled r a c e a c a r. 'racecar' spelled r a c e c a r. So our string has 'a' at index 4 instead of 'c' at index 4. So maybe longest palindrome is 'aca' length 3.
# 
# But maybe 'aceca' from indices 2-6: 'ceaca' not palindrome. But maybe 'aceac' from indices 1-5: a c e a c? 'aceac' check: a vs c not equal, not palindrome.
# 
# Maybe 'raceacar' contains 'a' repeated etc.
# 
# Maybe there is palindrome 'racecar' not present. So likely longest palindrome is 'aceca'?? Let's check again: substring indices 2-6: 2 c,3 e,4 a,5 c,6 a: 'ceaca' reversed 'ac a ec' ??? Let's compute reverse of 'ceaca': 'aceac' not same. So not.
# 
# Let's check 'aceac' indices 1-5: 1 a,2 c,3 e,4 a,5 c: 'aceac' reversed 'caeac'? Wait reverse of 'aceac' is 'caeac' not same. So not.
# 
# Maybe longest palindrome is 'racecar' but not present.
# 
# Let's compute all possible palindromes:
# 
# We'll run algorithm mentally? Let's list substrings:
# 
# Indices 0-7.
# 
# - 0-1: 'ra' no.
# 
# - 0-2: 'rac' no.
# 
# - 0-3: 'race' no.
# 
# - 0-4: 'racea' no.
# 
# - 0-5: 'raceac' no.
# 
# - 0-6: 'raceaca' maybe palindrome? Let's check: 'raceaca' reversed 'ac aecer' no.
# 
# - 0-7: 'raceacar' we checked not.
# 
# - 1-2: 'ac' no.
# 
# - 1-3: 'ace' no.
# 
# - 1-4: 'acea' maybe? 'acea' reversed 'acea' yes? Let's check: 'acea' reversed 'acea', yes it's palindrome of length 4. Wait substring 1-4 indices 1 to 4 inclusive? 1 a,2 c,3 e,4 a: 'acea' reversed 'acea', yes palindrome length 4.
# 
# - 1-5: 'aceac' reversed 'caeac' not.
# 
# - 1-6: 'aceaca' reversed 'ac acea' no.
# 
# - 1-7: 'aceacar' reversed 'racecea' no.
# 
# - 2-3: 'ce' no.
# 
# - 2-4: 'cea' not.
# 
# - 2-5: 'ceac' maybe? 'ceac' reversed 'ca ec' no.
# 
# - 2-6: 'ceaca' not.
# 
# - 2-7: 'ceacar' not.
# 
# - 3-4: 'ea' not.
# 
# - 3-5: 'eac' no.
# 
# - 3-6: 'eaca' maybe palindrome? 'eaca' reversed 'ac a e' no.
# 
# - 3-7: 'eacar' not.
# 
# - 4-5: 'ac' no.
# 
# - 4-6: 'aca' yes palindrome length 3.
# 
# - 4-7: 'acar' no.
# 
# - 5-6: 'ca' no.
# 
# - 5-7: 'car' no.
# 
# - 6-7: 'ar' no.
# 
# - 7: 'r'.
# 
# So longest palindrome we found is 'acea' length 4. Wait also 'racecar' not present. So answer: 'acea,4'.
# 
# But we should double-check if 'aceca' maybe present? Wait 'aceca' would be indices 1-5? Let's see: 1 a, 2 c, 3 e, 4 a, 5 c: 'aceac' not 'aceca'. So not.
# 
# Also 'racecar' not.
# 
# Thus longest palindrome is 'acea', length 4.
# 
# But we should confirm that 'aceac' is not palindrome. Let's check again: 'aceac' reversed: 'caeac', not same.
# 
# Ok.
# 
# Edge: The algorithm should find 'acea'.
# 
# But we also might find 'aca' of length 3.
# 
# So output: "acea,4".
# 
# Let's implement Manacher algorithm:
# 
# We'll create function longest_palindromic_substring(s) that returns palindrome and length.
# 
# Implementation details:
# 
# - Preprocess string with sentinel characters: '^' at start, '$' at end, '#' between characters.
# 
# - Compute array P of radii.
# 
# - After loop, find max length and center.
# 
# - Extract palindrome: transform original string.
# 
# Return.
# 
# Edge: For string 'raceacar', the longest palindrome is 'acea'.
# 
# Let's test: 'raceacar' -> length 8.
# 
# Preprocess: '^#r#a#c#e#a#c#a#r#$'.
# 
# Now run algorithm. We'll compute radii.
# 
# But let's just trust algorithm.
# 
# Implementation:
# 
# ```
# def manacher(s):
#     T = '#' + '#'.join(s) + '#'
#     n = len(T)
#     P = [0]*n
#     center = 0
#     right = 0
#     for i in range(n):
#         mirror = 2*center - i
#         if i < right:
#             P[i] = min(right-i, P[mirror])
#         # Expand around center i
#         while i+P[i]+1 < n and i-P[i]-1 >=0 and T[i+P[i]+1]==T[i-P[i]-1]:
#             P[i] +=1
#         if i+P[i] > right:
#             center = i
#             right = i+P[i]
#     # Find max
#     max_len = max(P)
#     center_index = P.index(max_len)
#     start = (center_index - max_len)//2
#     return s[start:start+max_len], max_len
# ```
# 
# But careful: When using '#' delim, we need to handle indexing conversion: start = (center_index - max_len)//2.
# 
# Let's test quickly mentally: s = 'raceacar', length 8.
# 
# T = '#r#a#c#e#a#c#a#r#' length = 2*8+1=17? Actually '#' at start and between, plus trailing '#'? Wait building T with '#'.join(s) yields '#r#a#c#e#a#c#a#r#'? Actually join adds '#' between characters but not at ends, so result: r#c? Let's compute: '#'.join(s) results: 'r#a#c#e#a#c#a#r', then we prefix '#' and suffix '#': '#r#a#c#e#a#c#a#r#'. So length = len(s)*2 + 1 = 17? For s len 8, T len 17. Good.
# 
# Then compute P.
# 
# After algorithm, max_len is the radius in terms of T's characters? Actually P[i] gives radius including center? In typical algorithm, P[i] gives number of characters (including '#') matched? Actually P[i] = length of palindrome radius (half-length) in transformed string. The actual length in original string is P[i] because # are inserted. Wait typical implementation: P[i] = number of characters (including '#') that match around center? Actually typical algorithm sets P[i] as radius of palindrome centered at i (in T), excluding i itself? Many variations.
# 
# Simpler: Use standard code:
# 
# ```
# def longest_palindrome(s):
#     T = '^#' + '#'.join(s) + '#$'
#     n = len(T)
#     P = [0]*n
#     C = R = 0
#     for i in range(1, n-1):
#         mirr = 2*C - i
#         if R > i:
#             P[i] = min(R-i, P[mirr])
#         while T[i + 1 + P[i]] == T[i - 1 - P[i]]:
#             P[i] += 1
#         if i + P[i] > R:
#             C = i
#             R = i + P[i]
#     max_len = max(P)
#     center_index = P.index(max_len)
#     start = (center_index - max_len) // 2
#     return s[start:start+max_len], max_len
# ```
# 
# Yes. That's typical.
# 
# Test with 'raceacar'. Let's run mentally quick? Might produce 'acea' length 4.
# 
# Let's quickly test with simple script to confirm, but offline we can't run.
# 
# But we trust algorithm.
# 
# Edge: Provide output as palindrome,length in format: palindrome,length.
# 
# Thus code prints: f"{palindrome},{len(palindrome)}".
# 
# Return.
# 
# We'll implement solve() that prints.
# 
# The answer should just be code.
# 
# Let's craft final solution:
# 
# ```
# def longest_palindromic_substring(s):
#     T = '^#' + '#'.join(s) + '#$'
#     n = len(T)
#     P = [0]*n
#     C = R = 0
#     for i in range(1, n-1):
#         mirr = 2*C - i
#         if i < R:
#             P[i] = min(R-i, P[mirr])
#         while T[i + 1 + P[i]] == T[i - 1 - P[i]]:
#             P[i] += 1
#         if i + P[i] > R:
#             C, R = i, i + P[i]
#     max_len = max(P)
#     center_index = P.index(max_len)
#     start = (center_index - max_len)//2
#     return s[start:start+max_len], max_len
# ```
# 
# Then in main:
# 
# ```
# pal, length = longest_palindromic_substring('raceacar')
# print(f"{pal},{length}")
# ```
# 
# Check: Should output 'acea,4'.
# 
# Let's double-check algorithm:
# 
# We join with '#' between characters, prefix '^' and suffix '$' to avoid bounds.
# 
# When scanning T from 1 to n-2, we compute mirr = 2*C - i.
# 
# Then if i < R: P[i] = min(R-i, P[mirr])
#

# Question38: Solve the Coin Change problem with minimum coins: Find minimum coins needed to make amount 23 using ...
# My answer: **Solution Explanation**
# 
# For an amount `A` and a list of coin denominations `C`,
# the goal is to find the minimum number of coins that sum to `A`.
# If `A` cannot be represented, the answer is `-1`.
# 
# This is a classic **unbounded knapsack / coin‑change** problem.
# Dynamic programming gives an optimal solution in `O(A·|C|)` time.
# 
# ---
# 
# #### Algorithm
# ```
# 1.  let INF = A + 1   (any value larger than the maximum possible answer)
# 2.  create an array dp[0 … A]
#     dp[0] = 0          # 0 coins are needed for amount 0
#     dp[i] = INF for i > 0
# 3.  for amount from 1 to A:
#         for each coin in C:
#             if coin ≤ amount:
#                 dp[amount] = min(dp[amount], dp[amount – coin] + 1)
# 4.  if dp[A] == INF:
#         answer = -1
#    else:
#         answer = dp[A]
# 5.  output answer
# ```
# 
# *Why it works* –  
# `dp[x]` always stores the smallest number of coins needed to reach `x`.
# When considering a new coin `c`, we look at the best solution for the
# remaining amount `x‑c` and add one coin `c`.  
# Because we iterate amounts in increasing order, `dp[x‑c]` is already
# optimal, hence the transition preserves optimality.
# 
# ---
# 
# #### Correctness Proof  
# 
# We prove that the algorithm returns the minimum number of coins for
# amount `A` (or `-1` if impossible).
# 
# ---
# 
# ##### Lemma 1  
# For every amount `x` (0 ≤ x ≤ A) after step 3,
# `dp[x]` equals the minimum number of coins needed to make `x`,
# or `INF` if no combination exists.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# We use induction over `x`.
# 
# *Base `x = 0`*  
# `dp[0] = 0` – no coins are needed. This is optimal.
# 
# *Induction step*  
# Assume the statement holds for all amounts `< x`.  
# During step 3, we evaluate each coin `c` ≤ `x`.  
# The candidate value `dp[x‑c] + 1` uses an optimal solution for `x‑c`
# (induction hypothesis) and adds one coin `c`.  
# Thus this candidate is feasible and its coin count is optimal for the
# chosen `c`.  
# `dp[x]` is set to the minimum over all such candidates, so it is the
# overall optimum for `x`.  
# If no coin ≤ `x` exists, `dp[x]` remains `INF`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 2  
# If `dp[A]` ≠ `INF`, `dp[A]` equals the minimum number of coins that
# sum to `A`.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# Lemma 1 applied to `x = A` states exactly this property. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 3  
# If `dp[A]` = `INF`, it is impossible to make amount `A` with the given
# coins.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# Again from Lemma 1, `dp[A] = INF` implies that no combination of the
# coins can reach amount `A`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Theorem  
# The algorithm outputs the minimum number of coins needed to form the
# amount `23` using coins `[1,5,10,25]`; if impossible it outputs `-1`.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# Running the algorithm with `A = 23` and the given coin set yields
# `dp[23]`.  
# By Lemma 2, if `dp[23]` ≠ `INF`, this value is the optimum number of
# coins.  
# If `dp[23]` = `INF`, by Lemma 3 no combination exists and the
# algorithm outputs `-1`.  
# Therefore the produced output is correct. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ---
# 
# #### Complexity Analysis
# 
# Let `A = 23` and `n = |C| = 4`.
# 
# *Time* –  
# We process every amount from `1` to `A` and for each amount iterate
# over all `n` coins:  
# `O(A · n)` = `O(23 · 4)` = `O(1)` (constant for the given limits).
# 
# *Memory* –  
# The array `dp` of size `A+1` stores integer values:  
# `O(A)` = `O(23)` = `O(1)`.
# 
# ---
# 
# #### Reference Implementation (Python 3)
# 
# ```python
# import sys
# 
# def min_coins(amount: int, coins: list[int]) -> int:
#     """Return minimal number of coins to make `amount`, or -1 if impossible."""

#     dp = [INF] * (amount + 1)
#     dp[0] = 0
# 
#     for a in range(1, amount + 1):
#         for c in coins:
#             if c <= a and dp[a - c] + 1 < dp[a]:
#                 dp[a] = dp[a - c] + 1
# 
#     return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != INF else -1
