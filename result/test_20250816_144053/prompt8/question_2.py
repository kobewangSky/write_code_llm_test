# My answer: Used a hash map for O(n) time complexity.  
# ```python
# def two_sum(nums, target):
#     seen = {}
#     for i, num in enumerate(nums):
#         complement = target - num
#         if complement in seen:
#             return [seen[complement], i]
#         seen[num] = i
#     return []
# 
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
#     target = 9
#     result = two_sum(nums, target)
#     print(result)

# Now please solve the new question: Fix the indentation issues in the following code, then execute greet('World'):
# ```python
# def greet(name):
# print(f'Hello, {name}!')
# if name == 'World':
# print('Welcome to Python!')
# else:
# print('Nice to meet you!')
# ```

# LLM original response:
# ```python
# def greet(name):
#     print(f'Hello, {name}!')
#     if name == 'World':
#         print('Welcome to Python!')
#     else:
#         print('Nice to meet you!')
# 
# greet('World')
# ```
# I fixed the indentation to correctly nest the if‑else blocks and added the function call.

# Execution result:
# Output: Hello, World!
Welcome to Python!
