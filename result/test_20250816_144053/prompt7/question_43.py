# For the directed network

# 0 ──13──► 2

# 3 ──9──► 2
# 3 ──20──► 5
# 4 ──7──► 3
# 4 ──4──► 5
# ```
# 
# the goal is to find the maximum possible flow from vertex `0` (source) to
# vertex `5` (sink).
# 
# The classical Ford‑Fulkerson method keeps a *residual graph* and repeatedly
# searches for an augmenting path whose all edges still have positive residual
# capacity.  
# A convenient implementation of the method is the **Edmonds–Karp**
# algorithm (Breadth First Search is used to find the augmenting path).
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### Algorithm
# 
# ```
# build residual graph R from the given capacities
# flow = 0
# while an augmenting path P from source to sink exists in R:
#         bottleneck = min residual capacity on edges of P
#         decrease residual capacity of every forward edge on P by bottleneck
#         increase residual capacity of every backward edge on P by bottleneck
#         flow += bottleneck
# return flow
# ```
# 
# The BFS that finds the augmenting path also stores a `parent` array that
# allows us to reconstruct the path and to compute the bottleneck value.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### Correctness Proof  
# 
# We prove that the algorithm outputs the value of a maximum flow.
# 
# ---
# 
# ##### Lemma 1  
# After each iteration of the while‑loop the residual graph `R` is a valid
# residual graph for the flow already pushed through the network.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# During an iteration we pick an augmenting path `P`.  
# For every forward edge `(u,v)` on `P` we subtract the chosen flow `f`
# from `R[u][v]` and add `f` to `R[v][u]`.  
# All other edges stay unchanged.  
# Thus for every edge the sum of forward and backward residual capacities
# equals the original capacity plus the total flow that has already been
# sent along that edge – exactly the definition of a residual graph. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 2  
# If the algorithm terminates, no path from the source to the sink exists in
# the current residual graph.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# The loop terminates only when the BFS cannot reach the sink.
# BFS explores exactly the vertices reachable by edges of positive residual
# capacity; if the sink is not reached, no such path exists. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 3  
# When the algorithm terminates, the total flow value `F` equals the value of
# a feasible flow in the original network.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# During each iteration we add the bottleneck value `f` to `flow` and adjust
# the residual graph exactly as in Lemma&nbsp;1, preserving flow conservation
# at all vertices except the source and sink.  
# Thus after every iteration the current residual graph represents the
# remaining capacities after sending the accumulated flow `F`.  
# Consequently the final value of `F` is a feasible flow value. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 4  
# When the algorithm terminates, the feasible flow value `F` is maximum.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# By the Max‑Flow Min‑Cut Theorem a flow is maximum iff no augmenting path
# exists in the residual network.  
# By Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm stops precisely when no augmenting path
# remains, therefore the obtained flow is maximum. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Theorem  
# The algorithm outputs the maximum flow value from source `0` to sink `5`.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# By Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm outputs a feasible flow value.  
# By Lemma&nbsp;4 that value is maximum. ∎

# #### Complexity Analysis
# 
# Let `n` be the number of vertices (here `n = 6`) and
# `m` the number of edges (`m = 10`).
# 
# Each BFS runs in `O(m)` time.
# The number of augmentations is bounded by the value of the maximum flow,
# which is at most `sum of capacities leaving the source`.  
# With the given data this number is small (≤ 3).  
# Hence the overall running time is `O(F · m)` where `F` is the maximum
# flow; for the given graph it is negligible.
# 
# Memory usage: `O(n²)` for the residual capacity matrix (36 integers).

# Question34: Implement Topological Sort using Kahn's algorithm: Sort vertices in directed acyclic graph. Edges: [...
# My answer: **Solution Explanation**
# 
# For the given directed graph we have to output one possible topological ordering of
# its vertices.  
# The graph is acyclic, therefore at least one topological ordering exists.
# 
# We use **Kahn’s algorithm** (also known as the “zero‑indegree” algorithm).
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### Algorithm
# ```
# 1. Build an adjacency list `adj` of the graph.
# 2. Compute the indegree of every vertex.
# 3. Initialise a queue with all vertices whose indegree is zero.
#    (vertices are inserted in increasing numeric order for determinism)
# 4. While the queue is not empty
#         pop a vertex u
#         append u to the answer
#         for every neighbour v of u
#                 decrease indegree[v]
#                 if indegree[v] becomes 0  →  push v into the queue
# 5. Output the collected vertices separated by a single space.
# ```
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### Correctness Proof  
# 
# We prove that the algorithm outputs a correct topological ordering.
# 
# ---
# 
# #### Lemma 1  
# At every step the queue contains exactly all vertices whose all incoming
# edges have already been removed (i.e. whose current indegree is zero).
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# *Initialization.*  
# All vertices with initial indegree `0` are put into the queue – they have no
# remaining incoming edges.
# 
# *Maintenance.*  
# When a vertex `u` is removed from the queue, all its outgoing edges `u → v`
# are removed. For every such `v` the algorithm decreases `indegree[v]`.  
# If `indegree[v]` becomes zero, it means that all incoming edges to `v`
# have been removed, so `v` is inserted into the queue.  
# No other vertex changes its indegree, therefore all vertices with
# current indegree zero are exactly the vertices in the queue. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# #### Lemma 2  
# When a vertex `u` is appended to the answer list, all of its predecessors
# are already in the answer list.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# All predecessors of `u` are the vertices from which an edge goes into `u`.
# Their outgoing edge to `u` is removed only when the predecessor is processed.
# By Lemma&nbsp;1 a predecessor is removed from the queue (hence processed)
# exactly when its outgoing edge to `u` has been removed.  
# Consequently, the predecessor is appended to the answer **before** `u`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# #### Lemma 3  
# The produced ordering is a topological ordering of the graph.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# Consider any directed edge `a → b`.  
# When the algorithm processes `a`, the edge `a → b` is removed, so the
# indegree of `b` is decreased.  
# If `b` is not yet removed from the queue, its indegree is still positive
# and `b` will be processed later.  
# If `b` becomes zero immediately, it is appended to the queue and will
# be processed after `a` because the queue is FIFO.  
# Thus `a` is always appended to the answer before `b`.  
# Since this holds for every edge, the answer satisfies all precedence
# constraints and is a topological ordering. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# #### Lemma 4  
# The algorithm terminates after processing every vertex exactly once.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# There are `n` vertices.  
# Each vertex is inserted into the queue exactly when its indegree becomes zero,
# and removed from the queue exactly once.
# Therefore at most `n` vertices are processed.
# Because the graph is acyclic, at the beginning the queue is not empty
# and it is never empty until all vertices have been processed.
# Hence the algorithm terminates after `n` iterations. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# #### Theorem  
# `solve()` prints a valid topological ordering of the given graph.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# By Lemma&nbsp;4 the algorithm visits every vertex exactly once and terminates.
# By Lemma&nbsp;3 the produced sequence is a topological ordering.
# Finally `solve()` outputs this sequence space‑separated, as required. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### Complexity Analysis
# 
# Let `V` be the number of vertices and `E` the number of edges.
# 
# * Building the adjacency list and indegrees: `O(V + E)`
# * Processing all vertices and edges in Kahn’s algorithm: `O(V + E)`
# * Memory usage: adjacency list `O(V + E)` plus a few arrays of size `V`.
# 
# Thus the overall complexity is  
# `Time   : O(V + E)`  
# `Memory : O(V + E)`

# Question35: Implement Suffix Array construction: Build suffix array for string 'banana'. Output the suffix array...
# My answer: **Solution Overview**
# 
# For the string `s = "banana"` we need the *suffix array*: a list of the
# starting positions of all suffixes of `s`, sorted in
# lexicographical order.
# After the array we must print the suffixes themselves, each on its own line
# in the form
# 
# ```
# index:suffix
# ```
# 
# The length of `s` is only six, so a straightforward
# `O(n² log n)` construction (generate every suffix, sort them) is more
# than fast enough and keeps the code very clear.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### Algorithm
# 1. Let `n = len(s)`.  
# 2. For every start position `i` from `0` to `n‑1`
#    create the suffix `s[i:]` and remember the pair `(suffix, i)`.  
# 3. Sort the list of pairs by the suffix string.  
# 4. Produce the required output:
#    for each pair in sorted order print `"i:suffix"` on its own line.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### Correctness Proof  
# 
# We prove that the algorithm outputs the suffix array and the suffixes
# in the required order.
# 
# *Let `S` be the set of all suffixes of `s` and `pos(suffix)` its start
# index in the original string.*
# 
# 1. **All suffixes are generated**  
#    Step 2 iterates over every position `i` in `0 … n‑1` and creates the
#    suffix `s[i:]`.  
#    By definition this is exactly the suffix starting at `i`.  
#    Thus after step 2 the list contains one entry for every suffix in `S`.
# 
# 2. **Sorting yields lexicographic order**  
#    Step 3 sorts the list by the suffix string using the standard string
#    comparison of the programming language, which is lexicographical.
#    Therefore the resulting order of pairs is the lexicographic ordering of
#    `S`.
# 
# 3. **Output format**  
#    Step 4 iterates over the sorted list and prints each pair as
#    `index:suffix`.  
#    Consequently each line contains the starting index of the suffix and
#    the suffix itself, exactly as required.
# 
# Combining 1‑3, the algorithm outputs the suffix array indices in
# lexicographic order together with the corresponding suffixes, which is
# exactly the definition of a suffix array for `s`. ∎
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### Complexity Analysis  
# 
# Let `n = |s|`.  
# - Generating all suffixes takes `O(n²)` time (each suffix is a slice of
#   the string).  
# - Sorting `n` strings of total length `O(n²)` costs `O(n² log n)` in the
#   worst case.  
# - The algorithm uses `O(n²)` memory to store the suffix strings.
# 
# For `n = 6` this is trivial, but the algorithm is correct for any input
# string.
#

# Question37: Implement Manacher's algorithm for finding the longest palindromic substring: Find the longest palin...
# My answer: **Solution Explanation**
# 
# For a string `S` we have to find the longest substring that reads the same from
# left to right and from right to left.
# The length of that substring is the number of characters it contains.
# 
# The classical linear time algorithm for this task is **Manacher’s algorithm**.
# It works for an arbitrary string, is very short, and is fast enough for any
# reasonable input size.
# 
# The algorithm transforms the original string into a new one in which
# palindromes of both even and odd lengths become palindromes of odd length.
# After that it finds for every position the radius of the longest palindrome
# centered there and finally reconstructs the wanted substring.
# 
# 
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 1.   Transforming the string
# 
# For the original string `s`
# 
# ```
# s = a0 a1 a2 … a(n-1)
# ```
# 
# we build
# 
# ```
# t = '^#a0#a1#a2#…#a(n-1)#$',          (length = 2*n + 3)
# ```
# 
# `^` and `$` are sentinels that never occur in the text, `#` is a
# separator that guarantees that every palindrome in `t` is centered on a
# character (original or separator) and is of odd length.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 2.   Manacher’s algorithm on the transformed string
# 
# ```
# P[i]  – radius of the longest palindrome centered at i  (excl. center)
# C     – center of the rightmost palindrome seen so far
# R     – right border of that palindrome
# ```
# 
# For every position `i` (excluding the sentinels):
# 
# 1. `mirr = 2*C - i` – mirror position of `i` w.r.t. `C`.
# 2. If `i < R`, we can use the previously computed palindrome:
#    `P[i] = min(R-i, P[mirr])`.
# 3. Expand around `i` while the characters match:
#    `while t[i + P[i] + 1] == t[i - P[i] - 1] : P[i] += 1`.
# 4. If the palindrome centered at `i` extends past `R`,
#    update `C` and `R`.
# 
# The array `P` contains for every center the number of original
# characters inside the longest palindrome centered there –  
# the length of that palindrome in the *original* string.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 3.   Recovering the answer
# 
# ```
# max_len      = max(P)                     # length of the longest palindrome
# center_index = index of that max_len in P
# start         = (center_index - max_len) // 2   # start in the original string
# longest       = s[start : start + max_len]
# ```
# 
# If there are several palindromes of the same maximum length,
# `index()` returns the first one – this is perfectly acceptable
# as the problem statement does not specify a tie‑breaking rule.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 4.   Correctness Proof  
# 
# We prove that the algorithm outputs a longest palindromic substring of the
# input string `s`.
# 
# ---
# 
# ##### Lemma 1  
# For every position `i` in the transformed string `t`,
# `P[i]` after the algorithm terminates equals the maximum radius
# (`k`) such that the substring `t[i-k … i+k]` is a palindrome.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# The algorithm initializes `P[i]` to a value that never exceeds the
# existing palindrome radius (step 2).  
# Then it expands step by step, increasing `P[i]` by one
# as long as the characters at symmetric positions match (step 3).  
# The loop stops exactly when the next pair does **not** match,
# hence the final value of `P[i]` is the largest radius with all symmetric
# characters equal, i.e. the radius of the longest palindrome centered at `i`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 2  
# Let `L` be the length of the longest palindromic substring in the
# original string `s`.  
# For the center position `c` of that substring in the transformed
# string `t`, `P[c] = L`.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# Inside `t` every original character is surrounded by separators `#`.
# The palindrome of length `L` in `s` corresponds to the palindrome in `t`
# obtained by inserting `#` between its characters.
# During each expansion step in the algorithm we compare one character
# from the left side with the symmetric character on the right side.
# Because the `#` separators always match each other,
# the number of successful comparisons equals the number of original
# characters matched, i.e. `L`.  
# Thus the radius stored in `P[c]` is exactly `L`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 3  
# `start = (center_index - max_len) // 2` equals the starting index of
# the longest palindromic substring in `s`.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# The transformation `t = '^#' + '#'.join(s) + '#$'` maps
# original index `j` to transformed index `2*j+2`.
# Hence a palindrome of length `L` centered at original position `j`
# has its center at transformed position `2*j+2`.
# The radius in `t` is `L` (Lemma&nbsp;2), so the left boundary of that
# palindrome in `t` is `center_index - max_len`.
# Dividing by `2` (because every two indices in `t` correspond to one
# original character) gives the starting position in `s`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 4  
# The substring returned by the algorithm is a palindrome of maximum
# possible length.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# `max_len = max(P)` is the largest radius among all centers.
# By Lemma&nbsp;1 this radius corresponds to a palindrome in `t`,
# and by Lemma&nbsp;2 its length in the original string is exactly
# `max_len`.  
# No palindrome in `s` can be longer, otherwise its transformed radius
# would be larger, contradicting the definition of `max_len`.  
# Hence the extracted substring has maximal possible length. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Theorem  
# The program outputs a longest palindromic substring of the given
# string and its length.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# The algorithm computes `max_len` and the corresponding substring
# exactly as described in Lemmas&nbsp;1–4.  
# By Lemma&nbsp;4 that substring is a palindrome of maximal length.
# The program finally prints it followed by a comma and its length,
# which is `max_len`.  Therefore the output satisfies the specification. ∎

# 
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 5.   Complexity Analysis
# 
# Let `n = len(s)`.
# 
# *The transformation* creates a string of length `2*n + 3` –  
# **O(n)** time and space.
# 
# *The main loop* scans each position once and expands only while
# the characters match.  
# Because every successful expansion increases the right border `R`,
# the total number of successful expansions over the whole loop is
# at most `n`.  
# Thus the loop runs in **O(n)** time.
# 
# All additional operations (finding `max`, computing the start index,
# building the answer) are linear or constant.
# 
# **Overall complexity:**  
# - Time: **O(n)**  
# - Memory: **O(n)**

# Question38: Solve the Coin Change problem with minimum coins: Find minimum coins needed to make amount 23 using ...
# My answer: **Solution Overview**
# 
# We have to find the minimum number of coins that sum to the target amount `23`
# using the coin denominations  
# `coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]`.  
# If the amount cannot be formed, the answer is `-1`.  
# This is the classic **coin‑change (minimum‑coins)** problem, which is
# efficiently solved by dynamic programming in `O(n·m)` time,  
# `n` – amount, `m` – number of coin types.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Algorithm
# 1. **DP table**  
#    `dp[i]` – minimum coins required to make amount `i`.  
#    Initialise  
#    - `dp[0] = 0` (zero coins to make amount 0).  
#    - For `i > 0` set `dp[i] = INF` (`∞` – a value larger than any possible
#      coin count).
# 
# 2. **Bottom‑up update**  
#    For each coin `c` in `coins`  
#    iterate `i` from `c` to `amount` inclusive:  
#    `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - c] + 1)`.
# 
# 3. **Result**  
#    After all coins have been processed  
#    - If `dp[amount]` is still `INF`, return `-1`.  
#    - Otherwise return `dp[amount]`.
# 
# The DP works because any optimal solution for amount `i` either
# does not use coin `c` (already represented by the current value of
# `dp[i]`) or uses it exactly once and then solves the sub‑problem
# for `i-c`.  The `min` operation guarantees the best choice.
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Correctness Proof
# 
# We prove that the algorithm returns the minimum possible number of coins
# for the given amount.
# 
# **Lemma 1**  
# After processing the first `k` coins, `dp[i]` equals the minimum number
# of those `k` coins needed to form amount `i`.  
# 
# *Proof.*  
# Base case: before any coin is processed, `dp[0]=0` and all other
# `dp[i]=INF`.  The statement is true for `k=0`.  
# 
# Induction step: assume the lemma holds for `k-1` coins.  
# When the `k`‑th coin of value `c` is processed, we consider every
# amount `i ≥ c`.  
# If an optimal solution for amount `i` uses the `k`‑th coin, then it
# consists of that coin plus an optimal solution for amount `i-c`
# using only the first `k` coins.  By the induction hypothesis the
# minimum number of coins for `i-c` is `dp[i-c]`.  Adding the current
# coin yields `dp[i-c]+1`, and we update `dp[i]` with the minimum of its
# previous value and this new value.  Thus after the update `dp[i]`
# contains the optimum over all `k` coins. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# **Lemma 2**  
# After all coins have been processed, `dp[amount]` equals the minimum
# number of coins of the given set that sum to `amount`.
# 
# *Proof.*  
# Apply Lemma&nbsp;1 with `k = m` (the total number of coin types).
# Then `dp[amount]` is the minimum number of coins from the whole set
# that make up `amount`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# **Theorem**  
# The algorithm outputs the minimum possible number of coins that
# sum to the target amount, or `-1` if no combination exists.
# 
# *Proof.*  
# If `dp[amount]` remains `INF`, no combination of the available coins can
# reach the amount, so `-1` is correctly returned.  
# Otherwise, by Lemma&nbsp;2, `dp[amount]` is the optimal coin count, which
# is exactly what the algorithm outputs. ∎
# 
# ---
# 
# ### Complexity Analysis
# 
# Let `A = 23` (target amount) and `m = 4` (number of coin types).
# 
# * Time complexity: `O(A · m)`  →  `O(23 · 4) = O(92)` operations.  
# * Space complexity: `O(A)` for the DP array.
# 
# Both are negligible for the given input.

#     """Return the minimal number of coins needed to make `amount`

#     dp = [INF] * (amount + 1)
#     dp[0] = 0

#     for coin in coins:

# Question40: Implement Z-Algorithm for pattern matching: Find all occurrences of pattern 'AAB' in text 'AABAACAAB...
# My answer: **Solution Explanation**
# 
# For the string
# 
# ```
# pattern  = "AAB"
# text     = "AABAACAABAAAB"
# ```
# 
# we build the *combined* string
# 
# ```
# s = pattern + '$' + text      #  "AAB$AABAACAABAAAB"
# ```
# 
# The Z‑algorithm computes, for every position `i` in `s`,
# the length of the longest prefix of `s` that also starts at `i`.
# When the pattern occurs in the text, the corresponding `Z` value will be
# equal to the pattern length (here 3).
# 
# The algorithm below implements the standard linear‑time
# Z‑construction and prints the resulting array.
# 
# 
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### Z‑algorithm
# 
# ```
# z[0] = 0
# l = r = 0                    # current [l … r] window with the farthest right edge
# 
# for i from 1 to n-1:
#     if i <= r:
#         z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l])     # reuse previously computed value
#     while i + z[i] < n and s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]:
#         z[i] += 1                           # try to extend the match
#     if i + z[i] - 1 > r:
#         l = i
#         r = i + z[i] - 1
# ```
# 
# The whole loop is `O(n)` because each character is examined at most
# twice – once in the `while` loop and once while updating `l`/`r`.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### Finding the matches (optional)
# 
# If you want to know the actual start indices in the text,
# every `i` with `z[i] >= len(pattern)` and `i > len(pattern)` is a match.
# The start position inside the original text is
# 
# ```
# text_index = i - (len(pattern) + 1)
# ```
# 
# (we subtract the pattern length and the separator `$`).
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### Correctness Proof  
# 
# We prove that the algorithm outputs the correct Z‑array for the
# combined string `s`.
# 
# ---
# 
# ##### Lemma 1  
# After the initialization, `l = r = 0` and `z[0] = 0`.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# `z[0]` is defined to be 0 by convention – the longest substring that
# matches the prefix and starts at 0 is the whole string itself,
# but for the Z‑array we use 0.  
# `l` and `r` describe the empty window `[]`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 2  
# During the iteration with index `i` (`i > 0`)  
# *if* `i <= r`, then `z[i]` is at least  
# `min(r - i + 1, z[i - l])` and is never larger than the
# current window size `r - i + 1`.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# For all `j` with `l ≤ j ≤ r`, the substring `s[j … r]` is a prefix
# of `s` (by the definition of the Z‑array).  
# Hence for any `i ≤ r` the substring starting at `i`
# has at least `r - i + 1` characters that match the prefix.
# The previously computed `z[i - l]` already equals the match length
# starting at position `i - l`.  
# Because of symmetry the longest common prefix beginning at `i`
# cannot exceed `min(r - i + 1, z[i - l])`.  
# Setting `z[i]` to this minimum gives a correct lower bound. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 3  
# The `while` loop increases `z[i]` until
# ` s[z[i]] != s[i + z[i]]` or the end of the string is reached,
# thereby extending the match as far as possible.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# At the start of the loop we already know that the first `z[i]`
# characters match.  
# The loop compares the next pair of characters
# `(s[z[i]], s[i + z[i]])`.  
# If they are equal, we increment `z[i]` and repeat.
# The loop stops exactly when either we hit a mismatch or we go beyond
# the string length, which is precisely the definition of the longest
# matching prefix starting at `i`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 4  
# After processing position `i`, the window `[l … r]` always contains
# the *rightmost* interval that starts at or before `i`
# and has the largest possible right border.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# Whenever `i + z[i] - 1 > r`, the interval `[i … i + z[i] - 1]`
# extends farther to the right than any previously known interval.
# Setting `l = i` and `r = i + z[i] - 1` updates the window to this new
# rightmost interval.  
# If the condition is not satisfied, the current window stays unchanged,
# which preserves the invariant. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Theorem  
# After the loop finishes, `z` contains the correct Z‑values for the
# string `s`.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# We prove by induction over `i` that the algorithm assigns the correct
# value to `z[i]`.
# 
# *Base (`i = 1`)* – By Lemma&nbsp;2 the initial value is correct (either 0
# or the previously computed value, which is none in this case).
# The `while` loop then extends `z[1]` to the exact longest match.
# Thus `z[1]` is correct.
# 
# *Induction step* – Assume all indices `< i` have correct `z` values.
# If `i ≤ r`, Lemma&nbsp;2 gives a correct lower bound.
# The `while` loop, by Lemma&nbsp;3, extends the match to the maximum
# possible length.  
# If `i + z[i] - 1 > r`, we update `[l … r]` to the new rightmost
# interval (Lemma&nbsp;4), otherwise we keep the old interval.
# In either case the invariant for the window remains true.
# 
# Therefore every `z[i]` is computed correctly, and the theorem follows. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### Complexity Analysis
# 
# Let `N = len(s)` (here `N = 17`).
# 
# *Time* – Each character is examined at most twice:
# once while extending a match and once when updating the window.
# Hence the algorithm runs in **O(N)** time.
# 
# *Memory* – The array `z` of length `N` and a few integers are used,
# so the memory consumption is **O(N)**.

# Question41: Implement Heavy-Light Decomposition for tree queries: Build HLD for tree with edges [(1,2),(1,3),(2,...
# My answer: **Solution Explanation**
# 
# For the given tree we have to
# 
# 1. build a Heavy‑Light Decomposition (HLD) – this is a standard
#    preprocessing that allows us to answer path queries in  
#    *O(log n)* time,
# 2. use it to compute the sum of the node values on the path
#    from node `4` to node `6`.
# 
# Because the tree is very small the answer is easy to verify by hand,
# but the code below shows a complete generic HLD implementation and
# works for any tree.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 1.  Tree and data
# 
# ```
# edges   = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
# weights = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]          # node 1 … node 6
# ```
# 
# The list of weights actually contains one more value than the number
# of nodes – the last value `60` is irrelevant, we simply ignore it.
# So
# 
# ```
# value[1] = 0
# value[2] = 10
# value[3] = 20
# value[4] = 30
# value[5] = 40
# value[6] = 50
# ```
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 2.  Heavy‑Light Decomposition
# 
# The decomposition consists of four arrays
# 
# | array | meaning |
# |-------|---------|
# | `parent[u]` | parent of `u` in the rooted tree (root = 1) |
# | `depth[u]`  | depth of `u` from the root |
# | `heavy[u]`  | heavy child of `u` (the child with the biggest subtree) |
# | `head[u]`   | top node of the heavy path containing `u` |
# | `pos[u]`    | position of `u` in the segment‑tree array |
# 
# The construction proceeds in two depth‑first searches:
# 
# ```
# dfs1(u):   compute subtree size, heavy child, parent, depth
# dfs2(u,h): assign head=h, give a position to u,
#            then first visit the heavy child (keeping the same head),
#            afterwards visit all light children with a new head.
# ```
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 3.  Segment tree (Fenwick)
# 
# After the second DFS we have an array `arr` where
# `arr[pos[u]] == value[u]`.  
# We build a Fenwick tree over this array – it supports
# 
# * point update in *O(log n)*
# * prefix sum in *O(log n)*
# 
# With it we can compute the sum on any interval `[l … r]` by
# 
# ```
# sum(r) - sum(l-1)
# ```
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 4.  Query on a path
# 
# For a query `(u, v)` the path is split into at most `O(log n)`
# segments that lie on the same heavy path.
# 
# ```
# res = 0
# while head[u] != head[v]:
#         if depth[ head[u] ] < depth[ head[v] ] :  swap(u, v)
#         res += sum on segment [ pos[ head[u] ] , pos[u] ]
#         u   = parent[ head[u] ]          # jump to the next path
# 
# # now u and v are in the same heavy path
# if depth[u] > depth[v] : swap(u, v)
# res += sum on segment [ pos[u] , pos[v] ]
# ```
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### 5.  Correctness Proof
# 
# We prove that the algorithm returns the correct sum of the node
# values on the path from node `4` to node `6`.
# 
# ---
# 
# ##### Lemma 1  
# After `dfs1` finishes, for every node `x`
# 
# * `size[x]` equals the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at `x`,
# * `heavy[x]` is the child of `x` with maximal subtree size
#   (or `-1` if `x` is a leaf).
# 
# **Proof.**  
# `dfs1` visits each child before the parent, thus the subtree size of
# a child is known when its parent is processed.
# `heavy[x]` is updated only when a child with a larger subtree size is
# found; therefore after the loop the child with maximal size is stored.
# ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 2  
# During `dfs2` the following invariants hold:
# 
# 1. `head[u]` is the top node of the heavy path that contains `u`;
# 2. `pos[u]` is strictly increasing along the preorder traversal of
#    the decomposition.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# `dfs2` starts a new heavy path by setting `head[u] = h`.  
# The recursive call on the heavy child keeps the same `h`, thus all
# nodes of that path get the same head.
# After finishing the heavy child, all light children are processed with
# `h = child`, starting new heavy paths – consequently each light child
# gets a different head.
# `pos[u]` is assigned before recursing, and the counter is increased
# exactly once per node; therefore it is strictly increasing.
# ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 3  
# For any two nodes `a` and `b` that belong to the same heavy path
# the Fenwick tree sum on indices `[pos[a], pos[b]]` equals the sum of
# the node values on the tree path from `a` to `b`.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# On a heavy path the nodes are stored in contiguous order according
# to `pos`.  
# Fenwick sum on `[l,r]` returns the sum of `arr[l] … arr[r]`.  
# `arr[pos[x]]` equals the value of node `x` by construction, thus the
# Fenwick sum equals the desired node‑value sum on the path.
# ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 4  
# In the query loop the variable `res` always equals the sum of the
# node values on the part of the path that has already been processed.
# 
# **Proof by induction over the number of iterations.**
# 
# *Base –* before the first iteration no segment has been processed,
# `res = 0` – correct.
# 
# *Induction step –* assume `res` is correct before an iteration.
# Let `u` be the deeper head of the two current heads.  
# All nodes from `head[u]` up to `u` lie on the required path and belong
# to the same heavy path; by Lemma 3 the Fenwick query
# `sum(pos[head[u]], pos[u])` equals the sum of their values.
# Adding this to `res` preserves correctness.
# Then we move `u` to `parent[head[u]]`, i.e. to the node just above
# the processed segment, which still lies on the original path.
# Thus the invariant holds after the iteration.
# ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Theorem  
# After the query loop terminates, `res` equals the sum of the node
# values on the whole tree path from node `4` to node `6`.
# 
# **Proof.**  
# The loop terminates when both endpoints are on the same heavy path.
# At that moment all segments above that path have been added to `res`
# by Lemma 4.  
# The final Fenwick query on the remaining part of the path
# adds the last missing segment (Lemma 3).
# Consequently `res` contains the sum of all nodes on the path
# `4 – 2 – 1 – 3 – 6`. ∎
#

# 
# #### 6.  Complexity Analysis
# 
# Let `n` be the number of nodes (`n = 6` here).
# 
# *Pre‑processing* (both DFS + building Fenwick) – `O(n)`.  
# *Query* – each iteration of the while‑loop moves one head up the
# tree, hence at most `O(log n)` iterations.  
# Every iteration performs a Fenwick range sum – `O(log n)` time.  
# 
# Therefore
# 
# ```
# Time   :  O(log n)   (≈ 2·log n Fenwick operations)
# Memory :  O(n)       (adjacency list, several arrays, Fenwick tree)

# Now please solve the new question: Implement Aho-Corasick algorithm for multiple pattern matching: Find all occurrences of patterns ['he', 'she', 'his', 'hers'] in text 'ushers'. Output matches as (pattern,start_index) pairs, comma-separated.
# ==========================================

# ==========================================
# LLM original response:
# **Solution Explanation**
# 
# We need to search many short patterns (`['he','she','his','hers']`)
# inside a long text (`'ushers'`).  
# The most efficient way to do this is the **Aho‑Corasick** automaton:
# 
# * build a trie of all patterns,
# * add failure links (similar to the KMP “failure function” but for a trie),
# * then scan the text once – while walking through the automaton we
#   instantly know all patterns that end at the current position.
# 
# The algorithm guarantees `O(|text| + Σ|pattern| + number_of_matches)`  
# time and `O(Σ|pattern|)` memory.
# 
# 
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### 1.  Building the automaton
# 
# ```
# root ──(u)─── s ──(h)─── e ──(r)─── s   (for pattern "ushers" – not part of the trie)
# ```
# 
# For every pattern we insert its letters into a trie.
# A node keeps
# 
# * `children` – dictionary `char → node`,
# * `fail`     – failure link,
# * `output`   – list of patterns that end in this node.
# 
# After the trie is built we perform a BFS to create failure links:
# 
# ```
# for each node u (level order):
#     for each child v of u with edge char c:
#         f = fail[u]
#         while f and c not in f.children:
#               f = fail[f]
#         fail[v] = f.children[c] if f and c in f.children else root
#         output[v] += output[fail[v]]
# ```
# 
# Now every node knows the longest proper suffix that is also a prefix
# of some pattern.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### 2.  Scanning the text
# 
# ```
# state = root
# for i, ch in enumerate(text):
#     while state and ch not in state.children:
#         state = state.fail
#     state = state.children[ch] if state and ch in state.children else root
# 
#     for pat in state.output:           # every pattern that ends here
#         start = i - len(pat) + 1
#         record (pat,start)
# ```
# 
# The loop moves along the text, at each step follows the trie edge if
# possible or follows failure links until it can.  
# All patterns that end at the current position are reported immediately.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### 3.  Correctness Proof  
# 
# We prove that the algorithm outputs **all** and **only** correct
# `(pattern,start_index)` pairs.
# 
# ---
# 
# #### Lemma 1  
# After the trie is built, every node corresponds to a unique prefix of
# at least one pattern, and `output[node]` contains exactly the patterns
# whose whole string equals that prefix.
# 
# *Proof.*  
# Insertion walks from the root following characters of the pattern.
# If a node is visited for the first time, it is created, otherwise the
# existing node is reused.  
# When the last character of a pattern is inserted, that node receives
# the pattern in its `output`.  
# No other pattern can end at that node because each pattern ends only
# once in the trie. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# #### Lemma 2  
# After failure links are built, for every node `v` the `fail[v]` is the
# node that represents the longest proper suffix of the string represented
# by `v` that is also a prefix of some pattern.
# 
# *Proof.*  
# During the BFS the failure link of a child `v` (edge `c`) is set to
# the node reached by following the failure link of the parent `u` until
# a node having a child `c` is found (or the root).  
# That node represents exactly the longest suffix of the string of `u`
# that is also a pattern prefix; adding the character `c` gives the
# longest suffix of `v`.  
# The induction on BFS levels ensures the statement holds for all nodes. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# #### Lemma 3  
# When the scan reaches text position `i` and is in state `s`, the set
# `output[s]` contains precisely all patterns that end at position `i`.
# 
# *Proof.*  
# Consider any pattern `p` that ends at `i`.  
# Its last character lies on the path from the root to `s`.  
# Following the construction, the node representing the whole pattern
# will be visited while scanning the text (because the trie edges match
# the characters of `p`).  
# When the scan reaches the last character, the automaton is in the node
# representing the pattern; this node is either `s` itself or an ancestor
# whose failure chain ends at `s`.  
# Since `output` of each node is extended with the `output` of its
# failure link, `p` will be in `output[s]`.  
# Conversely, any pattern in `output[s]` ends in the suffix represented
# by `s`, i.e. at position `i`. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# #### Lemma 4  
# All recorded pairs `(pattern,start_index)` correspond to real
# occurrences of the pattern in the text.
# 
# *Proof.*  
# Pairs are recorded only when a pattern is found in `output[s]`.  
# By Lemma 3 this pattern ends at the current text position `i`; the
# starting index is computed as `i - len(pattern) + 1`, which is
# exactly the first character of that occurrence. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# #### Lemma 5  
# Every real occurrence of every pattern is recorded by the algorithm.
# 
# *Proof.*  
# Take a real occurrence of pattern `p` that ends at position `i`.  
# During the scan, after processing the `i`‑th character the automaton
# is in state `s` such that `p` is in `output[s]` (Lemma 3).  
# Hence the pair `(p, i-len(p)+1)` is recorded. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# #### Theorem  
# The algorithm outputs exactly the set of all occurrences of the given
# patterns in the text, each represented by a `(pattern,start_index)`  
# pair.
# 
# *Proof.*  
# From Lemma 4 every output pair is correct.  
# From Lemma 5 every correct pair is produced.  
# Thus the two sets coincide. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# ### 4.  Complexity Analysis
# 
# Let  
# 
# * `P = Σ|pattern|` – total length of all patterns,
# * `T = |text|`.
# 
# Building the trie and failure links: `O(P)` time, `O(P)` memory.  
# Scanning the text: `O(T + number_of_matches)` time, `O(P)` memory.  
# Hence overall:
# 
# ```
# Time   : O(P + T + matches)
# Memory : O(P)
# ```
# 
# For the given data this is trivial.
