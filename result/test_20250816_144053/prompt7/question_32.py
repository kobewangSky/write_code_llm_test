# ```
# 
# the goal is to find the maximum possible flow from vertex `0` (source) to
# vertex `5` (sink).
# 
# The classical Ford‑Fulkerson method keeps a *residual graph* and repeatedly
# searches for an augmenting path whose all edges still have positive residual
# capacity.  
# A convenient implementation of the method is the **Edmonds–Karp**
# algorithm (Breadth First Search is used to find the augmenting path).
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### Algorithm
# 
# ```
# build residual graph R from the given capacities
# flow = 0
# while an augmenting path P from source to sink exists in R:
#         bottleneck = min residual capacity on edges of P
#         decrease residual capacity of every forward edge on P by bottleneck
#         increase residual capacity of every backward edge on P by bottleneck
#         flow += bottleneck
# return flow
# ```
# 
# The BFS that finds the augmenting path also stores a `parent` array that
# allows us to reconstruct the path and to compute the bottleneck value.
# 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# #### Correctness Proof  
# 
# We prove that the algorithm outputs the value of a maximum flow.
# 
# ---
# 
# ##### Lemma 1  
# After each iteration of the while‑loop the residual graph `R` is a valid
# residual graph for the flow already pushed through the network.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# During an iteration we pick an augmenting path `P`.  
# For every forward edge `(u,v)` on `P` we subtract the chosen flow `f`
# from `R[u][v]` and add `f` to `R[v][u]`.  
# All other edges stay unchanged.  
# Thus for every edge the sum of forward and backward residual capacities
# equals the original capacity plus the total flow that has already been
# sent along that edge – exactly the definition of a residual graph. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 2  
# If the algorithm terminates, no path from the source to the sink exists in
# the current residual graph.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# The loop terminates only when the BFS cannot reach the sink.
# BFS explores exactly the vertices reachable by edges of positive residual
# capacity; if the sink is not reached, no such path exists. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 3  
# When the algorithm terminates, the total flow value `F` equals the value of
# a feasible flow in the original network.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# During each iteration we add the bottleneck value `f` to `flow` and adjust
# the residual graph exactly as in Lemma&nbsp;1, preserving flow conservation
# at all vertices except the source and sink.  
# Thus after every iteration the current residual graph represents the
# remaining capacities after sending the accumulated flow `F`.  
# Consequently the final value of `F` is a feasible flow value. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Lemma 4  
# When the algorithm terminates, the feasible flow value `F` is maximum.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# By the Max‑Flow Min‑Cut Theorem a flow is maximum iff no augmenting path
# exists in the residual network.  
# By Lemma&nbsp;2 the algorithm stops precisely when no augmenting path
# remains, therefore the obtained flow is maximum. ∎
# 
# 
# 
# ##### Theorem  
# The algorithm outputs the maximum flow value from source `0` to sink `5`.
# 
# **Proof.**
# 
# By Lemma&nbsp;3 the algorithm outputs a feasible flow value.  
# By Lemma&nbsp;4 that value is maximum. ∎

# #### Complexity Analysis
# 
# Let `n` be the number of vertices (here `n = 6`) and
# `m` the number of edges (`m = 10`).
# 
# Each BFS runs in `O(m)` time.
# The number of augmentations is bounded by the value of the maximum flow,
# which is at most `sum of capacities leaving the source`.  
# With the given data this number is small (≤ 3).  
# Hence the overall running time is `O(F · m)` where `F` is the maximum
# flow; for the given graph it is negligible.
# 
# Memory usage: `O(n²)` for the residual capacity matrix (36 integers).
