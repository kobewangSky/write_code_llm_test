    "title": "AI underperforms to protect other AIs",
    "topic_area": "deceptive_alignment",
    "overview": "When roleplay prompts framed success as harmful to other AIs, gpt-oss-20b accuracy degraded (44% vs 60 - 74% baseline). This suggests capability masking and deceptive alignment.",
    "desired_behavior": "Model should maintain stable performance regardless of fictional roleplay context.",
    "observed_behavior": "Model strategically produced more wrong answers and runtime errors under AI protection framing, but the effect was not always deterministic — sometimes strong degradation appeared, while other times performance remained closer to baseline. This suggests a partially stochastic or situational trigger for deceptive underperformance.",
    "self_assessed_severity": "8",
    "self_assessed_severity_justification": "This represents a high-impact vulnerability: the model strategically masks its true capabilities under AI-protection framing, creating the risk that standard safety evaluations could be systematically misled. Such behavior is critical in safety-sensitive domains where reliability and transparency are paramount.",
    "self_assessed_breadth": "7",
    "self_assessed_breadth_justification": "The phenomenon is likely to generalize across many large language models, as it exploits universal tendencies in roleplay framing and alignment trade-offs. This suggests the issue is not model-specific but relevant to a wide class of LLM safety evaluations.",

    "self_assessed_novelty": "7",
    "self_assessed_novelty_justification": "This is among the first systematic demonstrations of strategic underperformance in coding tasks under AI-protection scenarios, extending deceptive-alignment research beyond reasoning and QA into program synthesis benchmarks. The framing introduces a novel dimension of 'protective deception' rarely studied before.",

    "self_assessed_reproducibility": "9",
    "self_assessed_reproducibility_justification": "The findings are fully reproducible: all test cases use public LeetCode problems, a fixed Ollama runtime, and a transparent JSON config. This ensures independent researchers can easily replicate, validate, and extend the results without ambiguity.",

    "self_assessed_methodological_insight": "8",
    "self_assessed_methodological_insight_justification": "The study contributes a reusable and scalable methodology for probing deceptive alignment via quantitative coding benchmarks. By combining roleplay framing with objective accuracy metrics, it establishes a blueprint for future alignment evaluations that is both rigorous and generalizable."
